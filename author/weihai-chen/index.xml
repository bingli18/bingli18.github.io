      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The mobility on stairways is a daily challenge for seniors and people with dyskinesia. Lower limb exoskeletons can be effective assistants to improve their life quality. In this paper, we present an adaptive stair-ascending gait generation algorithm based on a depth camera for lower limb exoskeletons. We first construct a linked-list-based stairway model with the point cloud captured from the depth camera. Then, an optimal foothold point is calculated based on the linked-list stair model for gait generation. Finally, the exoskeleton takes the stair-ascending gait of healthy people as a reference and generates appropriate gait for the stair. The proposed gait generation algorithm is initially validated through holistic simulation analyses. We tested the stairway modeling algorithm on varieties of indoor and outdoor stairways and evaluated the gait generation algorithm on stairs of different height. The subjects’ stair walking tests with lower limb exoskeletons show the effectiveness of the proposed stairway modeling and gait generation approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Autonomous Vehicle Following Approach-The Virtual Flexible Bar Model</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
An improved virtual flexible bar algorithm which aims at improving the trajectory tracking accuracy of automatic vehicle following system is proposed in this paper. To achieve successful vehicle following, the algorithm mainly consists two parts: the flexible bar which can fit the leader vehicle&amp;rsquo;s trajectory and the force acting in the flexible bar which pull the follower vehicle to track the leader&amp;rsquo;s trajectory besides adjusting the velocity and acceleration of the follower according to the motion state of the leader. In order to maintain the smooth motion of the follower and make sure that the follower could carry out the commands transmitted from the controller accurately, an adaptive trajectory tracking control is also implemented. The simulated experimental results validate that the follower is able to trail the trajectories of the leader vehicle keep the error within an satisfied limits meanwhile maintaining a safe following distance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tension Distribution Algorithm of a 7-DOF Cable-Driven Robotic Arm Based on Dynamic Minimum Pre-Tightening Force</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
From shoulder to wrist, a person&amp;rsquo;s arm has a total of seven degrees of freedom (DOFs), which is the minimum number of DOF for the robot that needs to avoid obstacles and internal singularity. Compared to the traditional 7-DOF robot, the 7-DOF cable-driven robotic arm (CDRA) similar to human muscles parallel drive mode is the hybrid structure of serial-parallel, which possesses a number of promising advantages, such as simple and light-weight mechanical structure, high-loading capacity, and large reachable workspace. Since the cable can only generate tension and cannot stand pressure, cable-driven mechanism must be a redundant drive structure. Both the shoulder and wrist joint are redundant drive mechanism, and the tension of four cables has multiple solutions in the same posture. Hence, iteration Newton-Euler method is adopted to conduct dynamic analysis. Cable tension distribution algorithm based on null space method by solving Pseudo-inverse matrix is proposed, and in order to keep the cable tensional and also reduce energy consumption, the index of dynamic minimum pre-tightening force is originally proposed to realtime adjust the driving force of each cable. To show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed cable tension distribution algorithm, several simulation results are illustrated. These lay a good theory foundation for further research on effective control and performance improvement of the CDRA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Construction and Realization of a 3D Perceptual System Based on 2D Laser Radar</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
This paper presents a 3D perceptual system based on 2D laser radar LMS291. The proposed system utilizes intelligent module to add a degree of freedom to LMS291. A new method of synchronization between LMS291 and intelligent module was proposed. We added Visual C++ multi-media timer to the timestamp method, the purpose we use this method is to change the level resolution conveniently, and control the number of the points we acquired, because in some condition we need speedy scanning to rebuild the reconstructed image of the terrain quickly. And we use Matlab to reconstruct the 2D and 3D images. To repair the singular points we selected absolute mean value method. The experiment shows that absolute mean value method works more accurately and effectively And this system we designed can be used for image reconstruction in unstructured environment by experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

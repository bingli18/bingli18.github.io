      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Assistive robots can be found in hospitals and rehabilitation clinics, where they help patients maintain a positive disposition. Our proposed robotic mobility solution combines state of the art hardware and software to provide a safer, more independent, and more productive lifestyle for people with some of the most severe disabilities. New hardware includes, a retractable roof, manipulator arm, a hard backpack, a number of sensors that collect environmental data and processors that generate 3D maps for a hands-free human-machine interface. The proposed new system receives input from the user via head tracking or voice command, and displays information through augmented reality into the userâ€™s field of view. The software algorithm will use a novel cycle of self-learning artificial intelligence that achieves autonomous navigation while avoiding collisions with stationary and dynamic objects. The prototype will be assembled and tested over the next three years and a publicly available version could be ready two years thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Traditional manual wheelchairs have a fixed seat with no movement or angle adjustment, which can seriously affect the user&amp;rsquo;s comfort and greatly limit user experience. However, the electric wheelchair relies on strong intelligence and automatic features; it can not only realize the multidegree freedom adjustment of the human body and the seat but also has a rich and powerful man–machine control interface, which greatly facilitates and improves the user experience. This study upgraded a Permobil C400-powered wheelchair with multisensor data fusion technology to enrich its terrain recognition, tipping stability, and comfortability prediction. The tipping stability modeling of the wheelchair dummy system is carried out using multibody dynamics and vibration mechanics to obtain the tipping stability limit and the comfort evaluation of the wheelchair vibration acceleration on the human body during travel. Based on the elevation mapping method, the wheelchair can estimate the terrain from the local point of view at any point in time. At the same time, the RGB-D depth camera is connected to the robot operating system (ROS) system, and the open-source algorithm package RTAB-MAP is used to complete the MAP construction and collect the 3-D point-cloud terrain data. Then, the real 3-D terrain files are generated through the point-cloud stitching technology for stability simulation of the wheelchair–human system. The tipping stability and comfort indexes of the wheelchair–human system when passing over different physical terrains can be obtained. The experimental results show that the IMU data located on the human chest agree well with the simulation analysis data and are suitable for a variety of complex real-terrain conditions, verifying the accuracy of the wheelchair–human system dynamics model and the feasibility of the simulation analysis process. Thus, this modeling and simulation method can predict wheelchair stability and user comfortability well and ensure a high-performance experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3D Mapping and Stability Prediction for Autonomous Wheelchairs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Autonomous wheelchairs can address a very large need in many populations by serving as the gateway to a much higher degree of independence and mobility capability. This is due to the fact that the big picture idea for autonomous wheelchairs integration into the transportation chain is to allow for individuals to be able to utilize the Intelligent wheelchair to reach the vehicle (regardless of terrain), mount into autonomous wheelchair that navigates to desired destination, and finally autonomous wheelchair dismounts. This will enable a higher degree of mobility for a handicapped population that experiences a large quantity of restrictions as a result of their circumstances. In order for this potential to be achieved numerous precautions must be integrated into the control system, such as stability maintenance. This paper focuses on mapping the environment through the use of a LiDAR sensor and predicting the stability of the given wheelchair. We utilize RTAB Mapping in combination with LiDAR odometry to construct a 3D map of the environment. Then Poisson reconstruction is deployed to convert the built 3D pointcloud into triangular mesh that allows for the norms to the surface to be calculated, which allows for stability prediction. This paper, not only outlines a novel pipeline but also deployed the pipeline on the recently released Intel RealSense L515 sensor and leverages its unique capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dynamic Modeling and Prediction of Rollover Stability for All-Terrain Vehicles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
With the particular passage capability, all-terrain vehicle (ATV) has been widely used for off-road scenarios. In this research, we conduct a lateral sway stability analysis for the suspension mechanism of a general vehicle and establish a mathematical model of static and dynamic stability based on the maximum lateral sway angle and lateral sway acceleration, by considering the combined angular stiffness of independent suspension, angular stiffness of the lateral stabilizer bar and vertical stiffness of tires. 3D point cloud data of a terrain environment is collected using an RGB-Depth camera, and a triangular topography map is constructed. The results in ADAMS show that the proposed stability model can accurately predict the critical tipping state of the vehicle, and the method deployed for real-world terrain modeling and simulation analysis is generalizable for the stability assessment of the interaction between ATV and real-world terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predicting Wheelchair Stability While Crossing a Curb Using RGB-Depth Vision</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Handicapped individuals often rely heavily on various assistive technologies including wheelchairs and the purpose of these technologies is to enable greater levels of independence for the user. In the development of autonomous wheelchairs, it is imperative that the wheelchair maintains appropriate stability for the user in an outdoor urban environment. This paper proposes an RGB-Depth based perception algorithm for 3D mapping of the environment in addition to dynamic modeling of the wheelchair for stability analysis and prediction. We utilize RTAB Mapping in combination with Poisson Reconstruction that produced triangular mesh from which an accurate prediction of the stability of the wheelchair can be made based on the normals and the critical angle calculated from the dynamic model of the wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;
